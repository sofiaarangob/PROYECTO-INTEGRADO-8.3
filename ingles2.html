    Eating Disorders <br><br>
Eating disorders are so common in America that 1 or 2 out every 100 students will struggle with one. The most common types of eating disorder are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa (usually called simply “anorexia” and “bulimia”: But other food-related disorders, like binge eating disorders, body image disorders, and food phobias, are showing up more frequently than they used to. <br><br>
ANOREXIA <br>
<div class="img1"></div>
People with anorexia have an extreme fear of weight gain and a distorted view of their body size and shape. As a result, they can’t maintain a normal body weight.
Some people with anorexia restrict their food intake by dieting, or excessive exercise. They hardly eat at all – and the small amount of food they do eat becomes an obsession.    Other people with eating disorders do something called binge eating and purging, where they eat a lot of food and then try to get rid of the calories by forcing themselves to vomit, using laxatives, or exercising excessively. <br><br>

BULIMIA <br>
<div class="img2"></div>
Bulimia is similar to anorexia. With bulimia, a person binge eats (eats far too much food) and then tries to compensate it extreme ways, such as forced vomiting or excessive exercise, to prevent weight gain. Over time, these steps can be dangerous.  To be diagnosed with bulimia, a person must be binging and purging regularly, at least twice a week for a couple of months. People with bulimia eat a large amount of food (often junk food) at once, usually in secret. The person typically feels powerless to stop eating and can only stop once he or she is too full to eat any more. <br><br>

Symptoms <br><br>

Some of the symptoms of bulimia may include the following: <br><br>

Living in fear of gaining weight and trying to lose weight in unhealthy ways. <br><br>
Repeatedly eating unusually large amounts of food at once. <br><br>
Feeling a loss of control during binge eating. You may feel like you can't stop eating or that you can't control what you eat. <br><br>
Vomiting on purpose or exercising to the extreme after a binge to avoid gaining weight. <br><br>
Using diuretics or medications that make you urinate, laxatives or enemas to evacuate stool even though they are not necessary. <br><br>
Fasting, limiting calories, or not eating certain foods between binges. <br><br>
Using dietary supplements or herbal products to lose weight. These products can be dangerous. <br><br>
Being very unhappy with your body shape and weight. <br> <br>
Let your body shape and weight guide how you feel and your worth. <br><br>

3. Why do bulimics eat so much?

R=
What is the nervous bulimia? <br><br>
Bulimia is a type of eating disorder. People with bulimia eat a larger amount of food than most people in a similar situation would, in a short period of time (binge eating). So, to avoid gaining weight, they do something to eliminate the food they ate (they purge). They may vomit, exercise too much, or use medications such as laxatives. <br><br><br>
